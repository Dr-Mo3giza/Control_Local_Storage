# Control_Local_Storage
This Challenge is about creating a control toolbox, that controls the local storage with features like adding an item to the storage deleting an item, checking if a specific item is in the storage, and finally, a button to show all items on the storage. I only used HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. Credits go to Elzero Web School Challenges.
